    <h1>Kiseki</h1>
<p>Go check the <a href="https://crrow.github.io/kisekifs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">doc</a>.</p>
<p>Kiseki is my learning rust project, a simple 'distributed' fuse file system that is port
of <a href="https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs" rel="noopener noreferrer">JuiceFS</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It's just a rust learning project</strong></p>
<p>If you don't know juicefs very much, the following is the introduction of juicefs:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#263238;"><span style="color:#eeffff;">JuiceFS is an open-source, high-performance distributed file system designed for the cloud. By providing full POSIX
</span><span style="color:#eeffff;">compatibility, it allows almost all kinds of object storage to be used as massive
</span><span style="color:#eeffff;">local disks and to be mounted and accessed on different hosts across platforms and regions.
</span><span style="color:#eeffff;">
</span><span style="color:#eeffff;">JuiceFS separates "data" and "metadata" storage. Files are split into chunks and stored in object storage like Amazon
</span><span style="color:#eeffff;">S3. The corresponding metadata can be stored in various databases such as Redis, MySQL, TiKV, and SQLite, based on the
</span><span style="color:#eeffff;">scenarios and requirements.
</span></pre>

<p>FUSE must be installed to build or run programs that use fuse-rs (i.e. kernel driver and libraries. Some platforms may
also require userland utils like <code>fusermount</code>). A default installation of FUSE is usually sufficient.</p>
<p>To build fuse-rs or any program that depends on it, <code>pkg-config</code> needs to be installed as well.</p>
<h2>Difference with juicefs</h2>
<h3>1. Write Buffer</h3>
<p>JuiceFS uses a pre-allocated memory and growable bytes pool as write buffer,
but this pool is also used for make reading buffer.</p>
<p>Kiseki's write buffer pool is fixed-size, and it is consist of a in-memory bytes
pool and a mmap file.</p>
<h3>2. Cache</h3>
<p>JuiceFs use disk-eviction mechinism to manage the writeback cache,
in Kisekifs, it employs <a href="https://github.com/moka-rs/moka" rel="noopener noreferrer">moka</a> to implement the
write back cache, much cleaner and efficient.</p>
<h3>3. How to read slices</h3>
<p>JuiceFs reorganize the slices into a linkedlist, kisekifs use <a href="https://github.com/jeffparsons/rangemap" rel="noopener noreferrer">rangemap</a> to
handle the trick part.</p>
