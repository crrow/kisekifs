# Why Kiseki?

Kiseki means miracle in Japanese, and I just pick it up from a Japanese
song while browsing the internet.

I am just interested in Rust and passionate about distributed systems.
Kiseki is my own exploration of building a file system in this language.

## Will you continue to develop it?

I don't know yet, the basic storage part is done, develop is fun and I have learned
a lot from it. So basically I have achieved my goal.
The rest of the work is endless posix compliance and performance optimization and
edge case handling, since i'm not employed by any company at present,
I have to focus on my job hunting and other stuff...
But who knows, we will see.

## Contribution

Very welcome, just open a PR or issue.

## Why JuiceFS?

While JuiceFS offers a powerful tool for data management,
porting it to Rust presents a unique opportunity to delve
into the inner workings of file systems and gain a deeper
understanding of their design and implementation.
